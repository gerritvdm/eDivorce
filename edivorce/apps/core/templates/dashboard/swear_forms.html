    <h3>What is swearing / affirming?</h3>
    <p>
        Affidavits you file with the court must be sworn / affirmed with a commissioner for taking affidavits.
        To swear or affirm an affidavit, you must meet with a commissioner for taking affidavits.
        The commissioner (often a lawyer, notary public or registry clerk) will check your photo id to make
        sure you are who you say you are, ask you if you understand the contents of your affidavit,
        then ask you to swear (oath on a Bible or other religious book) or affirm (non-religious promise)
        that the contents are true. The commissioner will then watch you sign the documents before signing it
        themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to swear / affirm your affidavits: with a commissioner at the court registry
        or with a notary or lawyer of your choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on your choices on the Signing and Filing Options step of this tool, this page will give you
        instructions on how you can swear or / and affirm your affidavits.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also based on your choices on the Signing and Filing Options step of this tool, you and your spouse
        may sign your affidavits together or separately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i> Once your affidavits are sworn / affirmed they must be filed with the court within 30 days.</i>
