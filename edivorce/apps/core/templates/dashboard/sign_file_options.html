    <h3>What is the process to file for divorce?</h3>
    <p>Ultimately you need to file (submit) your divorce with the Court Registry.
        Assuming everything goes well, your divorce will be reviewed by the
        Court Registry and passed along to a judge for approval.</p>
    <p>This tool will create a number of the key forms required for filing automatically.
        A few of these forms will need to be signed by you.
        At least one affidavit will require signing / swearing in front of a commissioner
        before being filed. There are also additional forms that are not generated by this tool
        that you'll need to complete.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining steps in this tool will walk you through the different forms you'll need
        and what to do with each of them.
        These steps will differ based on how you select to sign and file your documentation on this page.</p>
    <p>Once you've got your paperwork together, completed, signed and sworn, you can file it with
        the Court Registry.</p>
